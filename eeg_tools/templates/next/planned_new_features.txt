split between 

- postprocess measures (dimensionality reduction within rois, time windows and frequency bands)
- statistical calculation
- results plotting.

so after
proj_eeglab_study_compute_channels_measures
there will be a 

proj_eeglab_study_reduce_data
proj_eeglab_study_compute_statistics
proj_eeglab_plot_data


added operations to plot data without any statistical operation/thresholding
project.operations.do_study_plot_data



invert project.postprocessing.erp => project.erp.postprocessing
and so on.
